Single-handedly recruiting the founding core team. Ideated and successfully executed internship-based recruitments for next batch. This batch worked directly on IRDC.",
        para2: "Motivation for starting team: Dying out technical engineering culture and lack of challenging problems that interest almost everyone on campus irrespective of their branch of study was the main gap I identified. Also I really hated the seniority culture where juniors couldn't collaborate freely or have sufficient freedom to do things. Also, there lacked a strong competition based approach which led to loss of accountability on team's end and ever-extending project completion deadline. How Team started: I was very clear I needed to establish a team based on a tight project deadline. This was possible only if I could target competitions. I also sought competitions which had a multi-disciplinary approach of solving problems. Out of many international competitions, I found rover competition to be most feasible. I contacted around 5-6 teams from within India and the US to understand the technical complexity and budgeting of the rover and the competition. I understood and drew out an elaborate plan for the rover timeline, multiple competitions that we would take part in throughout the year, budget, technical teams, rover architecture and systems engineering. Once my plan was sufficiently ready, I started reaching out to my peers, juniors and seniors alike without any hesitation. To my surprise, a few showed genuine interest. But at the same time, a lot of peers openly mocked me in their groups (eg. Inspired karters FS) for my effort. They thought it was foolish to open a team with such a complexity, by a person who hasn't built anything before, in COVID times when our academic schedule was so hectic and collaboration being so difficult remotely and the worst part, no sponsorship opportunity due to economic recession. I would admit that I was discouraged and embarrassed but luckily I had got a few core members who believed in me and joined in reaching out to more people without second thoughts. This is how the momentum began and it kept on growing slowly but steadily.",
        para3: "Getting and arranging access to infrastructure such as dedicated workspaces (ICE labs, access to workshops and 3D printing, electrical lab room), onboarding a cohort of professors and Director Barai for mentoring and supporting team, leading the purchasing of all required items for rover manufacturing towards my stint end. Ideated the workshop-based recruitment pedagogy along with vice cap Uttank to minisme barrier of entry and attract best talents who are genuinely interested in team. Ideated and instilled core cultural values of team such as extreme focus on execution, targeting competitions hard, least team formal hierarchy between all batches for open communication, focusing on funds and marketing on campus, etc.  A small disclaimer: none of these were possible without help from others, I am grateful to all my batchies and juniors of that time who believed in my vision and extended their support.",
        para4: "My message for the team: You guys are freaking’ amazing and are doing fascinating tech. From 2021 since it took off, I am immensely proud of CRISS because of the kind of talent it attracts and retains and inspires to deliver top notch performances every year. Stay curious, stay hungry. Try to align whatever your team endeavors are with what you wanna do ahead in life. You will unleash almost unlimited willpower and excitement for things that matter to the team and more to yourself.",

        para1: "In the early days, it was all about collecting information and orienting ourselves in a realistic direction. We would reach out to tonnes of teams from other colleges, countries and whatnot. Some teams would be rather happy to tell us everything about how they do things. There were teams that even did things like custom building motors- stuff we couldn’t do even if we knew it all. Through this process, we learnt what to do, and more importantly, what not to do. We could identify gaps in how other teams operated since we’d seen so many different implementations aiming to solve the same problem.",
        para2: "At the same time, the early days was when none of us were technically all that sound XD.  We were learning as we progressed. We had to put together training programs for ourselves all while trying to figure out when to recruit juniors. That was an interesting challenge by itself. We’d brainstorm rather endlessly. I personally used to lead a lot of discussions astray at start XD, since some of my concerns were very often too theoretical. That’s actually how I ended up contributing a lot more to IRDC than to IRC.",
        para3: "However, most of my things were system level concerns, so I used to act as a system engineer despite being the embedded systems lead. Btw, I happened to be the one who pitched the “embedded systems” team within electrical because to me that felt like a role that was taken lightly but was essentially omnipresent. My vision was that every team needed its own member with expertise in embedded systems, and that we needed a centralized team that coordinated them all. Sometime in 3rd year, I had an accident and was bed-rested for about 6 weeks. That was actually when I really made the switch to being a system engineer though.",
        para4: "I’d coordinate Science and the newly formed “SciMech” teams since they really really had a lot of trouble speaking the same language at the time. This was true for any pair of teams really. Had to put together a lot of these worksheets to help science folks bridge the gap. Back then, the science team was essentially completely disconnected and had a nearly purely theoretical skillset. So I’d spend most of my time here. This was the reason why we came up with the recruitment process that y’all know of today- with the workshops that are (hopefully still being) conducted in LTC. With that, ’21 batch came along and were exposed to all concepts apriori, and electrical actually had a workforce, and stuff fell in place the way y’all know it today.",

While the director and many HoDs were supportive of our efforts, obtaining essential resources like lab space, sensors, and even mentors proved difficult.

With guidance from Dasgupta sir and the collective efforts of our team, we overcame most of the hurdles we faced. Although the initial journey was far from easy, it’s heartwarming to see that our efforts have paid off. The following generations have built on what we started, achieving more than we could have ever imagined.",
